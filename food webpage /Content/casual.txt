First Watch is always a favorite of mine and I am still working my way through trying everything on their menu. This time around I tried the Morning Meditation and Market Skillet Hash. The food was good and it was good value. It is definitely filling! My husband and I went early on a Sunday morning and it was quiet and empty. Our service could have been better, but still always a good experience.

The food isn't fresh here like other locations. It lacks flavor and presentation. The pancake and toast we got were both very soggy. The carrot and pecan pancake has raisins in it, which wasn't advertised on the menu. The service was decent. Our waiter was fine, didn't come around much. It was decently quiet for a week day in the early afternoon, typical ambience for brunch.

Amazing place I always take my family to. I always get their Cafe De Olla, and my wife loves their hues Divorciados. Service is always warm and welcoming. We've been going here for years, and recommend it to anyone in the area wanting to try authentic Mexican breakfast and lunch.

Buendia is an absolute gem. I was in the area hearing about it, but underestimated how busy this place was early in the morning. Wait time was around 45 minutes. Took a while to get my food, but overall service was decent but the food was spectacular. They have a fixed menu price for $15, so you know I had to get a steal with the number 2 breakfast entree.

Prep & Pastry was an absolute delight! I had the Duck Confit Hash, and it was heavenly. The service was quick and friendly, and the atmosphere was lively but not overwhelming. Their craft cocktails are a must-try, especially the Mimosa Flight.

The food was decent but definitely overpriced for what you get. I tried the Eggs Benedict, and while it was tasty, it came out lukewarm. The coffee was weak and not worth the price. The vibe is trendy but too crowded for my taste.
