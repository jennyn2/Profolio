Food here is delicious, no questions about it. But ever since their move to 4th ave, the price and the portions have been outrageous. I used to only spend about 12 bucks for a sandwich and friend, and now it's costing me 25 for a small sandwich. Love the food, but my wallet can't justify eating here.

Loved the chicken and waffles. Best chicken I've ever had. Laid back atmosphere and the cashier was also super friendly and kind!

Anello is the perfect little spot for a cozy date night. The Margherita pizza is phenomenal, with the crust having just the right amount of char. Their seasonal salads are also a must-try. Great ambiance and attentive service.

The pizza was good, but the wait time was ridiculous for such a small place. We waited 45 minutes for a table and another 30 minutes for our food. While the staff was nice, the experience didn’t justify the hype.

Tito & Pep blew me away! The Grilled Asparagus Tacos were incredible, and the smoky flavor from the wood-fired grill is unforgettable. The patio seating is lovely, and the staff was very welcoming.

The food was okay, but I wasn’t impressed. The portions are small, and the prices are high for what you get. The vibe is nice, but the menu felt limited. Might give it another try, but I’m not in a rush.
