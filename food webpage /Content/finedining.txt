My partner and I celebrated our anniversary here, and it was perfect. The filet mignon was cooked to perfection, and the lobster tail melted in my mouth. Our waiter was attentive and even surprised us with a complimentary dessert. Definitely worth every penny.

While the ambiance was nice, the food was underwhelming. My steak was overcooked, and the sides were bland. For the price, I expected much better. The server seemed rushed and inattentive. I don’t think I’ll be back.

RA Sushi is my go-to spot for happy hour! The Viva Las Vegas Roll and Pineapple Mojito are absolutely delicious. The staff is always upbeat, and the music gives it a fun vibe. It’s great for a casual night out.

The sushi is mediocre and overpriced compared to other spots in town. The service was slow, and my order was wrong twice. The loud atmosphere made it hard to enjoy the meal.

Had outstanding food for breakfast today with beautiful presentation and service. Calm, peaceful and of course always get the window seat for the view. Modestly sized dishes, and the huevos rancheros were the best I've ever had. Pancakes were also enormous. A place I would bring guests for delicious food in a special Southwestern ambiance.

Honestly, somewhat disappointed with this visit today. I've dined here before, but something about recently eating here the experience isn't the same as how it used to be. The Chippino was below average. Clams weren't even open when it came to my table, and the lack of seafood items on the dish made it lack in flavor. They even overcompensated by flooding the dish with wide sized noodles that were just ok. I've never seen noodles so wide in my life in Chippino, but hey for the lack of seafood it was a great compensation!
